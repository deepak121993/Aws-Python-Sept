1) Output of the code
    nums = set([1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4])
    print(len(nums))

A) 4

2)What will be the output?
    d = {"john":40, "peter":45}
    print(list(d.keys()))

A) ["john","peter"]

3)Write a for loop that prints all elements of a list and their position in the list.
 a = [4,7,3,2,5,9]

A) for i in range(0,len(a)):
        print(i, a[i])

4) Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print the
characters that have even indexes.
 Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:
 H1e2l3l4o5w6o7r8l9d
 Then, the output of the program should be:
 Helloworld

 A) for i in range(0,len(s)):
        if i%2==0:
            print(s[i])

5) Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print it in reverse
order.
 Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:
 rise to vote sir
 Then, the output of the program should be:
 ris etov ot esir

 A) print(s[::-1], end="")
