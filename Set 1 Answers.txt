# 1. What is the output of the following code?
nums = set([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4])
print(len(nums))
print([nums])

# Hint: Set consists unique element.

# Ans : 4 because one of each number.
# Query: when printing just the nums the output is {1, 2 , 3, 4}. What does {} represent
# because this is not a list nor a tuple and how would you extract or unpack individual values to print ?

# 2. What will be the output?
d = {"john": 40, "peter": 45}
print(list(d.keys()))
# Ans: As it is Key:value notation and output is will result in list ['John', 'Peter']
print(list(d.keys())[0])
# To Unpack the individual name John within the list
print(list(d.values()))
# output : [40 , 45]

# Hint: d.keys() is the function which will show keys


# 3.Write a for loop that prints all elements of a list and their position in the list.
a = [4, 7, 3, 2, 5, 9]
# Hint: Use Loop to iterate through list elements.
for i in a:
    print(i)

# 4.Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print the
# characters that have even indexes.
# Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:
letters = "H1e2l3l4o5w6o7r8l9d"
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# Helloworld
print(letters[0::2])

# 5. Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print it in reverse
# order.
# Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:
sentence = 'rise to vote sir'
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# ris etov ot esir
print(sentence[-1::-1])
